    severity: major
    description: To minimize attack surface on a Database server instance, only trusted/known and required IP(s) should be allowedto connect to it. An authorized network should not have IPs/networks configured to 0.0.0.0/0 which will allow access to the instance from anywhere in the world. Note that authorized networks apply only to instances with public IPs.
    human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will review the database instance configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that database connections are not permitted from 0.0.0.0/0.
    remediation_steps:
      terraform: For the google_sql_database_instance resource, set the authorized Networks parameter under ipConfiguration subblock to value other than 0.0.0.0/0.
      console:  Follow the guide at <https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances> in order to audit and delete any authorized networks with 0.0.0.0/0.

    human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will review the database instance configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that Google Cloud database instances have 'ipv4_enabled' attribute not set to true.
    remediation_steps:
      terraform: For the google_sql_database_instance resources, ensure that ‘ipv4_enabled’ attribute is set to false for Google Cloud SQL database instances.
      console: Follow the guides at <https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/private-ip>  and <https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/sql-restrictPublicIp>  in order to ensure that private IPs are used instead of public IPs.

    severity: major
    description: The interactive serial console does not support IP-based access restrictions such as IP whitelists. 
      If the interactive serial console is enabled on an instance, clients can attempt to connect to that instance from any IP address.
      This allows unwanted access to that instance if they know the correct SSH key, username, project ID, zone, and instance name. 
      Hence interactive serial console support should be disabled.
    human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will review the compute instances configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that metadata value for serial-port-enable is not set to true.
    remediation_steps:
      terraform: For the google_compute_instance resource ensure the metadata serial-port-enable is not set to true (default is false).
      console: Follow the guides at <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/interacting-with-serial-console> in order to disable the serial console access to the compute VM instance.

    severity: medium
    description: Shielded VMs are virtual machines (VMs) hardened by a set of security controls that help defend against rootkits and bootkits.
      Shielded VM instances run firmware which is signed and verified using Google's Certificate Authority,
      ensuring that the instance's firmware is unmodified and establishing the root of trust for secure boot.
      Shielded VM's verifiable integrity is achieved through the use of secure boot, virtual trusted platform module (vTPM), and integrity monitoring.
    human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will review the compute instances configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that the instances have Shielded VM attributes enabled.
    remediation_steps:
      terraform: For the google_compute_instance resource ensure the shielded_instance_config block has attributes enable_secure_boot, enable_vtpm and enable_integrity_monitoring set to true.
      console: Follow the guides at <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm> in order to turn on vTPM and integrity monitoring of VM instances.

      Automated backups need to be set for any instance that contains data that should be protected from loss or damage.
    human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will review the database instance configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that database connections has backup_configured set to enabled with a specified start time.

    description:
      The default compute engine service account has the Editor role on the project, which allows read and write access to most Google Cloud Services. To defend against privilege escalations if your VM is compromised and prevent an attacker from gaining access to all of your project, it is recommended to not use the default compute engine service account.
    human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will review the compute instances configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that the instances do not use default service account.
    remediation_steps:
      terraform: For the google_compute_instance resource ensure the service_account block has attribute email doesn’t use default service account [project_number]- compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com.
      console: Follow the guides at <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts>  and <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances> in order to ensure default service account is not used. VMs created by GKE should be excluded.

    severity: medium
    description: Contained databases have some unique threats that should be understood and mitigated by
      SQL Server Database Engine administrators. Most of the threats are related to the USER WITH PASSWORD authentication
      process, which moves the authentication boundary from the Database Engine level to the database level,
      hence it is recommended to disable ‘contained database authentication’ flag.
      This recommendation is applicable to SQL Server database instances. 
    human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will review the database instance configuration within your GCP subscription and
      Terraform plan to ensure that SQL Server database instances have ‘contained database authentication’
      database flag set to off.
    remediation_steps:
      terraform: For the google_sql_database_instance resources, ensure that ‘contained database authentication’
        database flag is set to off for SQL Server databases.

    description: The ‘cross db ownership chaining’ database flag allows the admins to control cross-database ownership
      chaining at the database level or to allow cross-database ownership chaining for all databases.
      Enabling cross db ownership is not recommended unless all of the databases hosted by the instance of SQL Server
      must participate in cross- database ownership chaining.
      This recommendation is applicable to SQL Server database instances.
    human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will review the database instance configuration within your GCP subscription and
