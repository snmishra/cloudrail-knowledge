      Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) policies determine which Transport Layer Security (TLS) features clients are permitted to use when connecting to external Google Cloud load balancers.
      Using outdated and insecure ciphers for the SSL policies associated with your HTTPS/SSL Proxy load balancers could make the SSL connection between clients and load balancers vulnerable to exploits.

      By default, the VPC Flow Logs feature is disabled when a new VPC network subnet is created. When enabled,
      VPC Flow Logs will start collecting network traffic data to and from your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) subnets.
